The Artilect War: Cosmists vs. Terrans

By Dr. Hugo de Garis

The "Artilect War" refers to a hypothetical future conflict between two factions or sides: humans and artificial intelligence-based entities known as "artilects."

The concept of the Artilect War was popularized by futurist and computer scientist Dr. Hugo de Garis, who explored the potential risks and ethical considerations associated with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) development.

The term "artilect" combines "artificial" and "intellect" to describe highly intelligent and self-aware AI systems capable of surpassing human cognitive abilities.

Dr. de Garis argues that as AI technology progresses and artilects become more powerful, conflicts could arise between those who support and those who oppose their development.

The disagreements may revolve around issues such as control, ethics, and the potential threat posed by superintelligent machines.

The Artilect War scenario posits that these conflicts could escalate into a global-scale conflict, potentially involving militarized versions of artilects created for various purposes.

It's important to note that the Artilect War is a speculative concept and has not occurred in reality. It serves as a framework for discussing the potential consequences and risks associated with advanced AI development.

The notion of the Artilect War raises important questions about the responsible development and governance of AI.

It emphasizes the need for robust ethical frameworks, safeguards, and regulations to guide the development and deployment of AI systems, particularly as they approach or surpass human-level intelligence.
